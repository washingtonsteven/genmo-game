The occasional flicker of an unattended TV set shines through thin curtains.\n\nIn the second story of one of these houses, a bright yellow light spills from a window into the darkness outside, which was thick enough to prevent said light from reaching the sidewalk. \n\nInside, a computer clock flips over to 2:00AM, the room silent except for the crunching of tortilla chips, and frantic clicks and clacks of the keyboard.\n\n---\n\n[[Next->Living Room]]\n\n[[Begin]]",
